## chapter 2 Groups

**Group** : group is a set of elements with a law of composition and they should satisfy the following properties:

- the law of composition should be associative

- $G$ has an identity element $1$ , such that $1a = a1 =a$ for all $a \in G$ 
- every element $a \in G$ has an inverse that is $b \in G$, such that $ab = 1$

*abelian group* : is a group whose law of composition is commutative.

property of composition law :

<details><summary>associative</summary> a(bc) = (ab)c, in Chinese is called 结合律.</details>

<details><summary>commutative</summary>ab = ba, in Chinese is called 交换律.</details>

**Cancellation law**
For $a,b,c \in G$, if we have $ab = ac$ or $ba = ca$, then we have $b = c$; And if we have $ab =a$ or $ba =a$, then we have $b = 1$.
